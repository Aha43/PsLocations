## wip on making end to end test list

Written with manual end to end testing in mind but the pester tests should cover all cases. The diference being here I will write 'cd ...' but in the pester test Set-Location probably will be used.

- [x] 1 create test area directory TestArea 
- [x] 2 create in test area a locations directory named TestLocations, set $env:LocHome to point to it 
- [ ] 3 make a directory under TestAres called Loc1 and make it the current dir
- [ ] 4 **loc status**
  - [x] 4.1 Home should be as expected 
  - [x] 4.2 Machine should be as expected 
  - [x] 4.3 Location count should be 0 
- [ ] 5 **create location: *loc add . 'Location 1'***
- [ ] 6 **loc l**
  - [ ] 6.1 One location should be listed
    - [x] 6.1.1 Position should be '0'
    - [x] 6.1.2 Name should be 'Loc1'
    - [x] 6.1.3 Path should end with 'TestArea/Loc1'
    - [x] 6.1.4 Description should be 'Location 1'
    - [x] 6.1.5 Only one machine should be listed 
    - [x] 6.1.6 The machine listed should be the one test are running
    - [x] 6.1.7 Exist should be true
- [x] 7 cd .. (move to TestArea)
- [x] 8 **loc '0'**
  - [x] 8.1 Working directory should now be 'Loc1'
- [x] 9 cd .. (move to TestArea)
- [x] 10 **loc 'Loc1'**
  - [x] 10.1 Working directory should now be 'Loc1'
- [x] 11 **loc rename . 'Loc1_renamed'**
- [x] 12 **loc list**
  - [x] 12.1 => Same as 6.1 but 6.1.2 shouls assert 'Loc1_renamed'
- [x] 13 cd .. (move to test area)
- [x] 14 **loc 'Loc1_renamed'**
  - [x] 14.1 Working directory should now be 'Loc1'
- [x] 15 **loc edit . 'Location 1 Edit 1'**
- [x] 16 **loc l**
  - [x] 16.1 => Same as 12.1 but 6.1.4 should assert 'Location 1 Edit 1'
- [x] 16 **loc edit 'Loc1_renamed' 'Location 1 Edit 2**
- [x] 17 **loc l**
  - [x] 17.1 => Same as 16.1 but 6.1.4 should assert 'Location 1 Edit 2'
- [x] 18 **loc note . 'Loc 1 Note 1'**
- [x] 19 **loc notes .**
  - [x] 19.1 Should list one note
  - [x] 19.2 Notes content should be 'Loc 1 Note 1'
- [ ] 20 **loc note 'Loc1_renamed' 'Loc 1 Note 2**
- [ ] 21 **loc notes 'Loc1_renamed'**
  - [ ] 21.1 Should list two notes
  - [ ] 21.2 Last note content should be 'Loc 1 Note 2'
- [ ] 22 **loc rename . .**
- [ ] 23 **loc l**
  - [ ] 23.1 => Same as 17.1 but location name should be Loc1 again.
